    <h2>First Dish: Nigerian Jollof Rice</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>Rice dishes are very common in most West-African cultures and the Nigerian jollof rice is one of many great variations. Jollof rice itself is popular in countries such as Ghana, Nigeria, and Senegal. Like I said in my food in theory article Nigerian Jollof 101 – Extras & Essentials, the debate on which country makes the best Jollof is one that could go on forever. As a Nigerian, I can say that aside from the taste and flavour, a beautiful thing about the Nigerian Jollof rice dish is how it varies. From the classic Jollof to party style Jollof and a recent favourite that is basmati Jollof and more.</p>
    <h3>How to make Classic Nigerian Jollof Rice:</h3>
    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Red bell pepper</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Fresh ginger</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Scotch bonnet pepper</li>
        <li>Chicken seasoning</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Paprika powder</li>
        <li>Dried thyme</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Vegetable stock</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>The Cooking Process:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Chop the tomatoes, onions, and bell pepper into chunks. Place into a blender/food processor together with the ginger, garlic, and scotch bonnet pepper. Then blitz into a smooth paste.</li>
        <li>Place a pot over medium heat, pour in the sunflower oil, and add the blended mixture. Stir and allow to sizzle, then place a lid over it, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>After simmering for 20 minutes, remove the lid, then add the spices and seasonings (Paprika, thyme, nutmeg, bay leaf, and salt). Stir altogether.</li>
        <li>Also pour in the rice and vegetable or meat stock and stir together.</li>
        <li>Place a piece of aluminum foil into the pot, covering the entire surface of the rice (this will keep the steam in), then place a lid over the pot. Cook for 20 minutes on low heat (Stirring occasionally to cook the rice evenly and also to prevent it from burning at the bottom).</li>
        <li>Remove lid, bin the aluminum foil and give the rice a gentle stir, then return the lid and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now the rice should be ready to serve. Serve hot with your favourite sides and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Tips:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Always fry your tomato paste very well.</li>
        <li>Jollof rice shouldn't really be boiled, rather it should be infused with steam.</li>
        <li>As soon as it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot and cook for 25 minutes. By this point, the rice should have absorbed all the liquid and be cooked through.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rice</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Carrot</li>
        <li>Hot dog</li>

        <li>Paprika</li>
        <li>Sweetcorn</li>
        <li>Green peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Cooking Process:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Begin by chopping carrots, hotdogs, paprika, and onions.</li>
        <li>Place a pot over the heat, pour in vegetable oil, add the onions, and then add the washed rice.</li>
        <li>Let the rice fry for a bit, then pour in water or turkey stock.</li>
        <li>Season the rice with salt, chicken seasoning, curry, and thyme, then cover and cook.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat another pot and add vegetable oil.</li>
        <li>Fry the hotdogs, then remove them from the pot.</li>
        <li>Next, add carrots, chopped paprika, onions, sweet corn, and green peas to the frying oil.</li>
        <li>Season the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Allow them to fry for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>After frying the vegetables, add them to the cooked rice along with the hotdogs.</li>
        <li>Mix everything together thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Your fried rice should now be ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cooking Tips for Fried Rice:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Give your rice a thorough rinse before cooking, it allows it to shed some starch and leads to less clumpy cooked grains.</li>
        <li>Don't overcrowd the pan: Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding the pan, which can lead to steaming instead of frying.</li>
        <li>My main tip is to prepare everything before you start cooking. If you are doing a fried rice with any protein or veggies that need more cooking time (bacon, chicken thighs, bok choy, broccoli, etc) sauté them first and set aside so you can add near the end of the fried rice to bring them back to temp or finish cooking them as desired.</li>
    </ul>
